generations:
  - name: "First Generation (AN40)"
    start_year: 2004
    end_year: 2015
    description: "The first-generation Toyota Innova was developed as a more passenger-focused MPV (Multi-Purpose Vehicle) replacement for the more utilitarian Kijang/Revo/Unser models that had been popular in Southeast Asian markets. Built on the IMV (Innovative International Multi-purpose Vehicle) platform shared with the Hilux pickup and Fortuner SUV, the Innova combined truck-based ruggedness with improved comfort and features suitable for family transportation. Featuring three rows of seating for seven or eight passengers depending on configuration, the Innova adopted a tall wagon-like design with conventional hinged doors rather than the sliding doors typical of minivans in other markets. Engine options varied by market but typically included 2.0 and 2.7-liter gasoline and 2.5-liter diesel units, paired with manual or automatic transmissions driving the rear wheels. The interior prioritized space and flexibility with multiple seating configurations, though material quality and features were relatively basic in lower trims. Higher specifications offered amenities like automatic climate control, leather seating, and enhanced audio systems to appeal to more affluent buyers. A significant facelift in 2008 updated the styling and interior, followed by another refresh in 2011 that further modernized the appearance. The first-generation Innova established itself as a versatile family vehicle particularly suited to developing markets across Asia, offering a combination of durability, practicality, and relative affordability that made it a popular choice for both private owners and commercial operators in the taxi and shuttle service industries."

  - name: "Second Generation (AN140)"
    start_year: 2015
    end_year: 2022
    description: "The second-generation Toyota Innova featured a more upscale, contemporary design with a prominent trapezoidal grille, complex headlight shapes, and more sophisticated surface detailing, marking a significant step up in perceived quality and presence. Still built on an updated version of the IMV platform shared with the Hilux and Fortuner, this generation maintained its body-on-frame construction while offering improved refinement and dynamics. Available with seven or eight-passenger seating across three rows, the Innova grew slightly in all dimensions, providing enhanced interior space particularly for third-row passengers. Engine options varied by market but typically centered around improved 2.0 and 2.7-liter gasoline engines and a new 2.4-liter GD-series turbodiesel replacing the previous 2.5-liter unit, all offering better performance, efficiency, and refinement than their predecessors. Transmission options included manual and automatic, both with additional gears compared to the previous generation. The interior saw a dramatic improvement in design and material quality, with a more car-like dashboard layout, higher grade plastics, and enhanced feature content including available ambient lighting, automatic climate control with rear controls, and a touchscreen infotainment system on higher grades. Safety technology expanded significantly with available features including multiple airbags, stability control, and hill-start assist. The second-generation Innova positioned itself as a more premium offering than its predecessor while maintaining the durability and practicality that had made the original successful, appealing to buyers seeking a robust family vehicle with enhanced comfort and features in markets across Asia, the Middle East, and parts of Africa."

  - name: "Third Generation (Innova Hycross/Zenix)"
    start_year: 2022
    end_year: null
    description: "The third-generation Toyota Innova, marketed as Innova Hycross or Zenix depending on region, represents a revolutionary change for the nameplate, transitioning from the traditional body-on-frame IMV platform to Toyota's TNGA-C unibody architecture shared with vehicles like the Corolla Cross. This fundamental shift creates a more car-like driving experience while maintaining the spacious three-row layout that defined previous generations. The exterior design evolves to a more SUV-inspired appearance with a prominent grille, muscular wheel arches, and an overall more premium presence. For the first time, the Innova adopts front-wheel drive instead of rear-wheel drive, enabling improved interior packaging and a lower, flatter floor. Also revolutionary is the powertrain lineup, centered around a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated gasoline engine in base models and, most significantly, Toyota's highly efficient hybrid system combining a 2.0-liter gasoline engine with electric motors for improved performance and substantially better fuel economy than previous diesel options. Transmission options include CVT for standard models and an e-CVT for the hybrid variants. The interior represents a complete reinvention with a horizontally-themed dashboard featuring a freestanding infotainment touchscreen (up to 10.1 inches), digital instrument cluster in higher grades, and much-improved materials throughout. Available luxury features include ventilated front seats, captain's chairs with ottomans in the second row, a panoramic sunroof, powered tailgate, and ambient lightingâ€”features unprecedented in the Innova lineup. Safety technology takes a major leap forward with Toyota Safety Sense 3.0 bringing pre-collision system, dynamic radar cruise control, lane tracing assist, and automatic high beams on higher trim levels. While maintaining the Innova's core identity as a spacious and practical three-row family vehicle, this generation elevates the model's refinement, efficiency, and feature content dramatically, aligning it more with crossover SUVs than the commercial-derived MPVs that preceded it."
